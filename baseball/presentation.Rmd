# BDA 696 Final Presentation

### Isaac Baumann - `r Sys.Date()`

class: inverse

# Agenda

--

1. What I'm predicting

--

2. Features

  - Cool (?) features
  - Boring features

--

3. Feature performance

  - Pre-modeling, which ones work and which don't
  - What I expected vs. what I didn't expect

--

4. Modeling (so far)

# What I'm Predicting

--

## Tired

Just predicting if the home team wins, nothing more

--

## Wired

I'm going hog-wild with the running average thing

--

Baseball changes quickly
--
, so I want to see how things work with a *30* day average and a *100* day average
 
--

Does recent performance better predict outcomes? Or is 100 (or maybe 100+) days better?

--

Basically *all* of my features will have a 30 day average version and a 100 day average version

--

No, I do not include all-time versions

## Time zones

--

- Shamelessly stealing from Ed's circadian rhythm idea

--

- Just assigning time zones to home teams and away teams, then combining them for each game to create a fixed effect

--

- Time zones don't change, so the FE should pick up differences due to teams' time zone differences

--

- MLB season is in standard daylight time, so no conversion needed for the Diamondbacks

## Rest time

--

- Time difference between a given game and the last game played by each team, adjusted for time zones

--

- Subtract 3 hours, since that's how long a typical baseball game lasts

--

  - Use length-of-game data? ¯`\_`(ツ)_/¯

--

## Rest time (extra innings-adjusted)

- The same as above, but adjusting for extra innings in the previous game

--

- 2019: average inning (top and bottom) lasted 20 minutes

--

  - Subtract 1/3rd of an hour from rest time for each inning past 9
  
--

  - Perfect? No. Good enough? Probably.

## [Pythagorean expectation](url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation)

--

.center[
$$ win\space ratio = \frac{1}{1 + (runs\space allowed / runs\space scored)^2} $$
]

--

- Represents predicted percentage of games a team *should* have won

--

- Ranked pretty highly in Julien's example!

## [Ballpark factor](url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_park_factor)

--

.center[
$$ park\space factor = \bigg( \frac{\frac{home\space runs\space scored + home\space runs\space allowed}{home\space games}}{\frac{away\space runs\space scored + away\space runs\space allowed}{away\space games}} \bigg) $$
]

--

- Represents how hitter/pitcher-friendly a home team's stadium is compared to other stadiums as well as how much a team's home ballpark is an advantage for that team

--

  - Batter-friendly if > 1
  
  - Pitcher-friendly if < 1

## [Cleanup hitter stats](url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanup_hitter)

--

The "cleanup" hitter is whoever is batting fourth in the lineup

--

  - The idea is the first three batters get on base, then the fourth "cleanup" batter scores them (and hopefully also himself)
  
  - Teams usually put their most powerful, most productive (in terms of RBI) batter in the fourth slot

--

Cleanup rate: how often runners score on the 4th batter's at-bats

Cleanup batting average: the 4th batter's batting average

--

### Problem

- Lots of lineup cards are missing from the `lineup` table

- Can get around this by finding the fourth batter for each team in `inning` table
